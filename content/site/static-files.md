# Static files

All static files, such as images and HTML/CSS/JS files are automatically served from the `./assets` folder. Just add your files here and they will be served.

For example, if you have an image at `./assets/logo.png`, it will be copied to the built folder, `./public/assets/logo.png`. We also copy some default assets, like libraries for syntax highlighting.
